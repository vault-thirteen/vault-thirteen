Hello there and welcome to the **Vault Thirteen** _GitHub_ repository.

## What is this ?

This repository stores files of various software products written in various 
programming languages.

A more detailed description of this _GitHub_ account will be placed here when 
the time comes. For now, only the most important facts are stated here. 

## AUX

Please, do note that due to a very big complexity of the process of creation of 
open-source software, a decision was made to merge a lot of small libraries, 
packages, repositories and other types of software units into a single _GitHub_ 
repository. This joint repository is called `Auxie` (while the word `AUX` is not 
available on all the operating systems). More information about it can be found 
at the following link â€“ https://github.com/vault-thirteen/auxie.

If you have been using some of the old repositories of this _GitHub_ account 
earlier in the past time and feel that you can not find the old repository any 
more, we suggest that you look into the 
[Auxie](https://github.com/vault-thirteen/auxie) repository mentioned above. 
Source files of numerous old repositories have been merged into that one.
